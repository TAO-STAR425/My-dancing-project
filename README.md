💃🕺 Tango (The Dance)
🌍 Origins

Tango was born in the late 19th century in the working-class neighborhoods of Buenos Aires, Argentina, and Montevideo, Uruguay.
It grew from a blend of:

African rhythms

European immigrant traditions

Criollo (local) music

What started as street and barroom dancing evolved into one of the world’s most iconic partner dances.

🎵 Music Characteristics

Tango music is:

Dramatic and emotional

Often led by the bandoneón (a type of accordion)

Based on walking steps and strong rhythms

Sometimes smooth and melancholic, sometimes sharp and playful

Famous composers/performers: Ástor Piazzolla, Carlos Gardel, Osvaldo Pugliese, Juan D’Arienzo.

🕺💃 Major Styles of Tango
1. Argentine Tango

The original form — deeply expressive and improvisational.
Key traits:

Close embrace (but adjustable)

Subtle, intimate lead-and-follow communication

Walking, pivots, ochos, ganchos, boleos, sacadas

Strong musical interpretation & connection

This is the style danced socially at milongas.

2. Ballroom Tango

Standardized for competitions and ballroom dance.
Key traits:

More dramatic and staccato

Sharp head movements and lines

A more rigid frame than Argentine tango

Often danced to different, more theatrical music

There are two ballroom variations: International and American.

4. Milonguero Style

A close-embrace social form.
Key traits:

Compact steps

Very close chest connection

Ideal for crowded dance floors

Connection: The silent communication between partners is central.

Expressiveness: Dancers interpret the music with emotional nuance.

Culture: Tango is tied to Argentine social traditions, music, poetry, and gatherings.
