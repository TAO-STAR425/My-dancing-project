💃🕺 Tango (The Dance)
🌍 Origins

Tango was born in the late 19th century in the working-class neighborhoods of Buenos Aires, Argentina, and Montevideo, Uruguay.
It grew from a blend of:

African rhythms

European immigrant traditions

Criollo (local) music

What started as street and barroom dancing evolved into one of the world’s most iconic partner dances.
